RGS also provides a slew of financial aid schemes. Financial assistance schemes such as the MOE Independent School Bursary (ISB), school-administered scholarships and bursaries and other bursaries by self-help groups and external institutions are available to our students to help them continue with their education and motivate them to strive for greater accomplishments. School-administered financial aid includes subsidies and compulsory level-wide school activities.
