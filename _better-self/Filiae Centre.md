# Filiae Centre
The Hong Leong Foundation Filiae Centre, is a one-stop student development centre (a first for Singapore secondary schools). The Centre supports and inspires students to engage in enjoyable and enriching school experiences, nurturing their growing understanding of self and community, and on how they can contribute to a global society. Services and programmes at the Filiae Centre will enable you to develop a sense of balanced wellness in these dimensions of wellness: physical, social, emotional, intellectual, spiritual, vocational, contextual and developmental.

# Counselling
# 
Students go to their school counsellors when they want to speak with a trusted adult about issues that they are troubled by, and it is no different at RGS. Issues like stress, anxiety, relationships with peers and family, to name a few, are discussed in individual and group counselling with a professionally-trained counsellor. 


# Coaching

Teenagers confide in their peers about matters that are bothering them or when they want to know how to become better at certain things. Besides speaking with counsellors, students at RGS also have the option of talking to a peer-helper who is trained in solution-focussed coaching skills and techniques, and who receives supervision from a coaching supervisor. 

# Thrive Sessions

To thrive is to develop well, flourish and succeed. Through our Thrive Sessions, you will be motivated about learning (beyond academics), become psychologically resilient, socially and emotionally competent, have a positive outlook on life and proactive personality. Examples of Thrive Sessions are workshops on balanced wellness, resiliency-building, arts-based therapy for mindful self-care and movie therapy for mental health education. 

# Educational and Career Guidance

While the services and programmes above address several dimensions of wellness, Educational and Career Guidance (ECG) focuses mainly on the intellectual and vocational aspects, ECG helps students explore their values, attitudes and aptitudes in relation to careers they may aspire towards. To facilitate the latter, students undergo work experience programmes, participate in career days and industry visits, and more.
