Character & Leadership Education (CLE) is an integral part of the RGS mission to nurture the high ability girl to be a leader who will realise her talents in service of nation and community.

Through the CLE curriculum, each RGS girl learns what it means to be a person of good character and develops the knowledge and competencies to become a daughter of a better age as:
* A good steward of her life
* An active and socially responsible citizen
* A reflective and visionary leader

CLE forms the basis of the Raffles Programme, as it is attended to at four levels:
* Infusion and integration in every subject
* School-wide structures, policies and practices
* Co-curricular programmes
* CLE curriculum
