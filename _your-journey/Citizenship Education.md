Guided by the RGS NE Framework, Citizenship Education in RGS develops in Rafflesians a critical appreciation of the context and constraints Singapore faces so that a deeper sense of belonging and rootedness can be developed.

## Engage in Community
Our students’ social consciousness and active citizenry are fostered through Learning Journeys Week, a programme that seeks to engage the students experientially in understanding the Singapore story and the role they can play in our nation’s progress.

## Embrace Diversity
We empower our students by providing opportunities to co-initiate and organise NE-related events such as Racial Harmony Day and participate in NE-related seminars/ competitions.

## Think With Purpose
Student-initiated platforms allow our students to lead their peers to engage in dialogue with academics, top civil servants and professionals to develop multiple perspectives and understanding in nation building.
