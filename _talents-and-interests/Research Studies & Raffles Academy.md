# Research Studies &amp; Raffles Academy

Research Studies (RS) is a subject taken by all Year 2 students and is a platform for talent development. In RS, students work in groups on either a research project or a creative problem-solving project with the guidance of a teacher mentor.


Raffles Academy (RA) is for Year 3 and Year 4 students who are ready to be stretched in an area of their interest and talent. Students may take a research module, which is like an RS project but with a higher level of content and intensity, or a coursework module, which is classroom based but with advanced content of a discipline. Participation in RA is by choice.

In preparation for RS, students learn research and inquiry skills which have been infused in the Year 1 and Year 2 academic curricula. The table below illustrates where these skills have been infused.
