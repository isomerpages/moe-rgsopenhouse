At RGS, you will find a wide range of talent development opportunities for students to develop and nurture their gifts into talents. On this page, you will find an overview of talent development, with more information on **Research Studie**s and **Raffles Academy**, which are talent development platforms.

Talent is developed in and out of the classroom. A student may develop her talent in the four areas using the platforms listed below. Just as each student is unique and will have different educational goals, you too may follow a different path in talent development, towards achieving your educational goals.

# Research Studies & Raffles Academy

Research Studies (RS) is a subject taken by all Year 2 students and is a platform for talent development. In RS, students work in groups on either a research project or a creative problem-solving project with the guidance of a teacher mentor.


Raffles Academy (RA) is for Year 3 and Year 4 students who are ready to be stretched in an area of their interest and talent. Students may take a research module, which is like an RS project but with a higher level of content and intensity, or a coursework module, which is classroom based but with advanced content of a discipline. Participation in RA is by choice.

In preparation for RS, students learn research and inquiry skills which have been infused in the Year 1 and Year 2 academic curricula. The table below illustrates where these skills have been infused.

The next table lists the programmes that fall under the umbrella of Research Studies and Raffles Academy.
