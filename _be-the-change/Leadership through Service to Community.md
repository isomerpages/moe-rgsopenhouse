# Leadership through Service to Community

**Values-in-Action (VIA)**

As a school that seeks to develop the aspiration and capacity for service to nation and community in every student, the RGS Values-in-Action (VIA) programme provides enriched and differentiated experiences within a vibrant environment of stewardship and service. The programme seeks to build in each student, the capacity to advocate by deepening their understanding of and responsibility in addressing community issues. We aim to enable each student entering RGS, with different strengths and aptitude towards service, the opportunity to discover her passions and develop according to her level of readiness.

**Community Youth Leaders (Direct School Admissions)**

A talent development programme which nurtures students, who are passionate in serving the community, to lead as active agents of change. In turn, they also inspire others to make a positive difference in their spheres of influence.**

**Community Problem Solving Programme (CmPS)**

The Community Problem Solving (CmPS) Programme is a differentiated programme for students with a strong passion for service and want to advocate on social issues in the community. Working in teams of about six to eight members, students use problem-solving skills to address real-world problems. They identify a community area of concern, explore challenges, establish an underlying problem, propose an action plan and carry out proposed solutions (partnering stakeholders) to address the issue at hand. Students then reflect on their experience so they can build on these experiences in other service-learning projects.

Some examples of CmPS projects include: inspiring children to pursue STEM careers, educating and working with students to build proper posture, equipping seniors to become competent technology users and advocating the importance of coral reefs on our ecosystem.

**Project S-Move (Environment-related)**

Area of Concern

The team sought to improve traffic conditions so as to create a safer environment for their school-mates. The students worked with the school's safety committee to implement changes to the school's traffic SOPs.
 
Underlying Problem

Given that traffic congestion in RGS is due to the occasional inattention of traffic rules by drivers, how might we increase drivers' mindfulness so that we can improve the school's traffic conditions at the arrival plaza in the year 2021 and beyond?

**Project Coral.Ful (Environment-related)**

Area of Concern

The team sought to advocate to the general public regarding the significance of coral reefs to our ecosystem; the students set up information booths in NLB libraries to help the public better understand the significance of the issue.

Underlying Problem

Given that there is a lack of awareness of the state of coral reefs in Singapore, how should we educate youths on the importance of preservation of corals so that they can taken actions to ensure the protection of our corals in the year 2021 and beyond?

**Project GenTECH (People-related)**

Area of Concern

The team sought to build seniors' competency in leveraging digital tools to improve their quality of life; the students had partnered Goldman Sachs to produce an app, and are now working with an alumnae to refine the app for public use.
 
Underlying Problem

Given that seniors aged 60 and above are not harnessing the wide array of technology available to assist them in their daily activities, how might we better encourage them to integrate technology into their lives, so that they will embrace technology with confidence in the year 2021 and beyond?

**Student-Initiated Values-In-Action (SVIA) Projects**

he school encourages students to self-initiate projects that enable them to serve in a cause(s) they are passionate to address. SVIA projects are passed on between batches of students to sustain support to partner agencies.

Some examples of SVIA projects include: advocating for animal welfare and environment conservation, reading and academic support programmes, student advocacy for individuals with special needs, developing children’s interest in STEM, and many more…

Project Honey and Bread is an example of a SVIA project that strives to partner other stakeholders to address an issue of concern. The team collaborated with their RI counterparts to support Care Corner Toa Payoh seniors during the 2021 year-end holidays.
