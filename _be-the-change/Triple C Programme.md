The Triple C Programme, which stands for Care, Collaboration and Community, symbolises our deep desire to continue the RGS legacy of community engagement and partnership.

The programme hopes to:

 *   Nurture in students a sense of connectedness to societal issues
    
*   Develop our leadership and interpersonal skills
    
*   (and) Facilitate student outreach
    
		
Launched in 2019, the Triple C Programme is a tripartite collaboration between RGS, primary schools and Social Service Agencies within the Braddell-Toa Payoh vicinity.

The Triple C Programme creates a common space for interactions regardless of socio-economic background, age or ability. At its heart, this programme is about connectedness. 

As participants collaborate and share ideas together to support the community, relationships are formed.

The powerful ingredient in this collaboration is undoubtedly, community-centeredness. Over time, we hope to see the Triple C Programme grow to involve more schools and SSAs.
