The House System which comprises five Houses, Tarbet (Red), Buckle (Green), Richardson (Blue), Waddle (Yellow) and Hadley (Purple), nurtures the students’ sense of belonging and loyalty to the school by fostering sisterhood, team and school spirit through its activities. 

**Co-curricular Activities (CCAs) Executive Committee**

CCA Leaders ensure that their CCAs are not only a platform to discover and hone their interests and talents but also to provide friendship opportunities and a sense of belonging, promoting passion for the group’s interests, teamwork and a spirit of service to the community.

**Class Executive Committee**

Class Exco members play an integral role in developing and promoting class identity, class spirit as well as a caring and supportive learning environment for all.
  
**Peer Helper**

Through building one-to-one positive peer relationships, peer helpers journey with fellow students by assisting them in their academic and personal concerns. They work with the peer student leaders to reinforce the culture of care in RGS.
