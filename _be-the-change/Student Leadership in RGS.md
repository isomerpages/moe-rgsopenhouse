# Student Leadership in RGS

Every RGS student has the potential to be a leader who can make a positive difference in her spheres of influence. There are many ways for a student to develop her leadership potential. The RGS Student Leadership Roadmap provides clear pathways for students to grow as leaders based on their interests and competencies. Your skills in leadership will be developed and nurtured in RGS.

Leadership of Self is developed through the 4-year Character Leadership Education programme which provides the foundation for the student to be a good steward of her life.

As for Leadership of Others, the school provides a range of suitable platforms within and beyond the school to develop studentsâ€™ leadership based on their interest and readiness to become change agents among their peers, in the school and in the larger community.

Students may lead through service to School and Community via:

*   Values-in-Action (VIA)
    
*   Leadership Boards (Prefectorial Board, House, Peer Support Board, Student Congress and House)
    
*   CCA Executive Committee
    
*   Class Executive Committee
    
*   School-wide committees
    
*   Peer Helper
    
These platforms develop leadership traits and competencies in students, guided by the RGS Student Leadership Roadmap, according to their areas of interest and aspirations, always with the aim of developing strong citizenship and responsibility to the community.


**Student Leadership Provisions**

The student leadership provisions serve to create a dynamic supportive environment where student leaders work collaboratively amongst themselves, and with other stakeholders to cultivate the holistic development of students, and peers who bond, help and influence each other positively; and where the culture of care and support is extended to others within and beyond its grounds.
