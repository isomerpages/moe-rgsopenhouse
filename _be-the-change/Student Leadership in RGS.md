# **Student Leadership Development**



The goal of student leadership development is to nurture every RGS girl to be a leader who values diversity, cohesiveness, and inclusiveness in exerting positive influence and impact of the community. 

**Leadership of Self**  is developed through the 4-year Character Leadership Education programme which provides the foundation for the student to be a good steward of her life.

  
As for **Leadership of Others**, the school provides a range of suitable platforms within and beyond the school to develop students’ leadership based on their interest and readiness to become change agents among their peers, in the school and in the larger community.**


## **Student Leadership Provisions**

The student leadership provisions serve to create a dynamic supportive environment where student leaders work collaboratively amongst themselves, and with other stakeholders to cultivate the holistic development of students, and peers who bond, help and influence each other positively; and where the culture of care and support is extended to others within and beyond its grounds.**
