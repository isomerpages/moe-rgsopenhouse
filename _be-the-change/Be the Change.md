# Student Leadership in RGS

Every RGS student has the potential to be a leader who can make a positive difference in her spheres of influence. There are many ways for a student to develop her leadership potential. The RGS Student Leadership Roadmap provides clear pathways for students to grow as leaders based on their interests and competencies. Your skills in leadership will be developed and nurtured in RGS.

Leadership of Self is developed through the 4-year Character Leadership Education programme which provides the foundation for the student to be a good steward of her life.

As for Leadership of Others, the school provides a range of suitable platforms within and beyond the school to develop students’ leadership based on their interest and readiness to become change agents among their peers, in the school and in the larger community.

Students may lead through service to School and Community via:

*   Values-in-Action (VIA)
    
*   Leadership Boards (Prefectorial Board, House, Peer Support Board, Student Congress and House)
    
*   CCA Executive Committee
    
*   Class Executive Committee
    
*   School-wide committees
    
*   Peer Helper
    
These platforms develop leadership traits and competencies in students, guided by the RGS Student Leadership Roadmap, according to their areas of interest and aspirations, always with the aim of developing strong citizenship and responsibility to the community.


**Student Leadership Provisions**

The student leadership provisions serve to create a dynamic supportive environment where student leaders work collaboratively amongst themselves, and with other stakeholders to cultivate the holistic development of students, and peers who bond, help and influence each other positively; and where the culture of care and support is extended to others within and beyond its grounds.

# Leadership through Service to School

***   Prefectorial Board**
    
The Prefects act as role models for their peers and are the custodians of the school culture. They uphold the code of conduct in the school. 
 

***   Peer Support Board**
    
The Peer Support Leaders provide guidance and support to their peers, and advocate for a culture of care amongst the students. 

  
***   Student Congress**
    
Student Congress leaders promote active citizenship by garnering feedback and suggestions from students for the purpose of collective improvement of RGS.
  
***   House**
    
The House System which comprises five Houses, Tarbet (Red), Buckle (Green), Richardson (Blue), Waddle (Yellow) and Hadley (Purple), nurtures the students’ sense of belonging and loyalty to the school by fostering sisterhood, team and school spirit through its activities. 

***   Co-curricular Activities (CCAs) Executive Committee**

CCA Leaders ensure that their CCAs are not only a platform to discover and hone their interests and talents but also to provide friendship opportunities and a sense of belonging, promoting passion for the group’s interests, teamwork and a spirit of service to the community.

***   Class Executive Committee**

Class Exco members play an integral role in developing and promoting class identity, class spirit as well as a caring and supportive learning environment for all.

  
***   Peer Helper**

Through building one-to-one positive peer relationships, peer helpers journey with fellow students by assisting them in their academic and personal concerns. They work with the peer student leaders to reinforce the culture of care in RGS.
 
# Leadership through Service to Community
**Values-in-Action (VIA)**

As a school that seeks to develop the aspiration and capacity for service to nation and community in every student, the RGS Values-in-Action (VIA) programme provides enriched and differentiated experiences within a vibrant environment of stewardship and service. The programme seeks to build in each student, the capacity to advocate by deepening their understanding of and responsibility in addressing community issues. We aim to enable each student entering RGS, with different strengths and aptitude towards service, the opportunity to discover her passions and develop according to her level of readiness.

Some of the key activities led by student leaders are:

*   Y1 Service-Learning Learning Journey
    
*   Y2 Class VIA project
    
*   Community Problem Solving Project (CmPS)
    
*   Student-Initiated VIA Project (SVIA Project)
    
*   Raffles Policy Dialogue
    
*   In-Conversation
    
*   SVIA Committee
    
An annual Community Fair (conducted during Post-End of Year Assessment) brings the community together to celebrate each other's service-learning efforts via sharing sessions, and enables teams to hand-over projects to their school-mates to enable sustainability of service to the community.

**Community Youth Leaders (Direct School Admissions)**

A talent development programme which nurtures students, who are passionate in serving the community, to lead as active agents of change. In turn, they also inspire others to make a positive difference in their spheres of influence.**

**Community Problem Solving Programme (CmPS)**

The Community Problem Solving Programme is a differentiated programme for students with a strong passion for service and who want to understand key issues in the community and use problem solving skills to solve real world problems. Working in teams, students identify an area of concern in a community, explore challenges, establish an underlying problem, propose and implement an action plan to solve the problem, and reflect on their learning and their impact on the community.

Examples of CmPS teams that strive to address school-related and external community issues are:

**Project S-Move (Environment-related)**

Area of Concern

The team sought to improve traffic conditions so as to create a safer environment for their school-mates. The students worked with the school's safety committee to implement changes to the school's traffic SOPs.
 
Underlying Problem

Given that traffic congestion in RGS is due to the occasional inattention of traffic rules by drivers, how might we increase drivers' mindfulness so that we can improve the school's traffic conditions at the arrival plaza in the year 2021 and beyond?

**Project Coral.Ful (Environment-related)**

Area of Concern

The team sought to advocate to the general public regarding the significance of coral reefs to our ecosystem; the students set up information booths in NLB libraries to help the public better understand the significance of the issue.

Underlying Problem

Given that there is a lack of awareness of the state of coral reefs in Singapore, how should we educate youths on the importance of preservation of corals so that they can taken actions to ensure the protection of our corals in the year 2021 and beyond?

**Project GenTECH (People-related)**

Area of Concern

The team sought to build seniors' competency in leveraging digital tools to improve their quality of life; the students had partnered Goldman Sachs to produce an app, and are now working with an alumnae to refine the app for public use.
 
Underlying Problem

Given that seniors aged 60 and above are not harnessing the wide array of technology available to assist them in their daily activities, how might we better encourage them to integrate technology into their lives, so that they will embrace technology with confidence in the year 2021 and beyond?

****Student-Initiated Values-In-Action (SVIA) Projects

SVIA Projects is a differentiated programme for students with a strong passion for service. Working in teams of two to 15 members, students identify an area of concern in a community, explore challenges and propose an action plan to serve their identified community. They then carry out their service and reflect on their experience in service to the community.

Project Honey and Bread is an example of a SVIA project that strives to partner other stakeholders to address an issue of concern. The team collaborated with their RI counterparts to support Care Corner Toa Payoh seniors during the 2021 year-end holidays.
