The Raffles Programme is a six-year curriculum jointly offered by Raffles Girls’ School and Raffles Institution. Students graduate with the Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate in Education (GCE) Advanced Level Examination. It is a broad-based and rigorous curriculum for highly-able students, with various pathways for the development of special interests and strengths, and an emphasis on character and leadership development.

# Curriculum Design

Our academic curriculum is designed to respond to the needs of curious, passionate and highly-able girls. We adopt an integrative approach in organising our curriculum for gifted learners through three dimensions as shown in the diagram.

At RGS, we recognise that each student is differently able, has different interests and has different learning styles, so we do our best to cater to the individual learner’s needs. We achieve this in our curriculum through differentiation. For example, students who require more guidance in a subject are given scaffolds to support their climb to success, while those who are ready for the challenge and independence, are given the resources they need to soar. There is enough space in RGS for every student to develop her passion for learning and be successful.

# A Passion For Learning

The RGS classroom fosters in our students a passion for lifelong learning. Our students experience a learner-centred environment, where they acquire knowledge that is authentic, there is focus on the process, and interdisciplinary connections are made.

# Continual Assessment

Learning is a journey; continual assessment is a central feature of our assessment approach, as it gives our students regular feedback on their growth. Multiple types of assessments are used throughout the school year to guide learning. Assessment for learning, known as formative assessment, and assessment of learning, known as summative assessment, are both emphasised in developing mastery of content and process skills in our students.

# STEM Education & Digital Literacy 

STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Our approach to STEM education involves collaboration among the teachers and coordination of the curriculum of the STEM disciplines in a manner that facilitates our students’ understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of the STEM disciplines, provides them opportunities to apply their knowledge and skills of STEM to real world problems, and develops in them the  [21st century competencies](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/21st-century-competencies) identified by Singapore’s MOE.


In line with STEM education, the use of digital technology is part and parcel of our students’ learning experience. We teach our students to use digital technology responsibly as they harness its power to enhance their learning. Every student uses her own laptop in and out of the classroom as a tool for learning, to access educational material and resources, to collaborate with her peers and teachers, and to create digital work or products using productivity applications.

We also offer various platforms for students to extend their understanding and application of digital technology, from basic coding to more advanced programming. The diagram below provides some examples of platforms for STEM education.

Below is an example of STEM education in the classroom. This is an excerpt of a Year 2 performance task (which is like a class-based project) combining the disciplines of Mathematics and Science.

# Sandbox@RGS
Sandbox@RGS is a feature in the journey of STEM Education in RGS. It is a space suitably resourced for programmes that nurture the RGS girl's sense of free spiritedness and empathy. Its overarching theme for use is Technology for Good. With its instructional framework grounded in Design Thinking and Computational Thinking, Sandbox@RGS is a safe space for students to collaborate, ideate, incubate their ideas, create prototypes and gather feedback as they work on their technological solutions to problem solve in the areas they have identified.

Sandbox@RGS is the place to be for all tech-related activities and programmes. These include Design & Technology, the Innovation Programme and CCAs like InfoComm and Robotics. Through such a facility, students learn to serve as their own helpline to one another. Catering to queries and experimentation, CCA clubs like InfoComm and Robotics will be available for consultation and mentoring. It would be an environment to:

* Interact & Exchange: For students to share their ideas
* Investigate: For students to undertake projects, actualise their ideas or produce prototypes
* Document & Capture: For students to create a video/photograph of their products (supported by the CCA Photographic Society)
* Develop: For students to loan and try new technologies (e.g. microcontrollers, app designing and gadgets) and test their ideas
* Present: For students to conduct or participate in student-led workshops or attend as audience members (TechTalk@Sandbox)

The affordances of Sandbox@RGS as an innovative learning space help students build up their 21st century skills and competencies.
