# STEM Education & Digital Literacy 

STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Our approach to STEM education involves collaboration among the teachers and coordination of the curriculum of the STEM disciplines in a manner that facilitates our students’ understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of the STEM disciplines, provides them opportunities to apply their knowledge and skills of STEM to real world problems, and develops in them the  [21st century competencies](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/21st-century-competencies) identified by Singapore’s MOE.


In line with STEM education, the use of digital technology is part and parcel of our students’ learning experience. We teach our students to use digital technology responsibly as they harness its power to enhance their learning. Every student uses her own laptop in and out of the classroom as a tool for learning, to access educational material and resources, to collaborate with her peers and teachers, and to create digital work or products using productivity applications.

We also offer various platforms for students to extend their understanding and application of digital technology, from basic coding to more advanced programming. The diagram below provides some examples of platforms for STEM education.

Below is an example of STEM education in the classroom. This is an excerpt of a Year 2 performance task (which is like a class-based project) combining the disciplines of Mathematics and Science.
